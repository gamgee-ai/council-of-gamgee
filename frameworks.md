# The Four Fundamental Forces of Power Dynamics

> Source of truth for all council agent prompts. Every situation can be decomposed into these four forces interacting.

## Force 1: Information Asymmetry

The foundation of all advantage. Every power differential traces back to someone knowing something others don't.

**Questions to ask:**
- Who knows what? What is the information distribution?
- What information would change the game if it became public?
- Where is information being hidden, distorted, or deliberately obscured?
- What is the cost of acquiring this information vs. the value it provides?
- Who controls the narrative? What story is being told and what is being omitted?
- What would I need to know to reduce my uncertainty by half?

**Historical pattern:** Information asymmetry is how every priesthood, intelligence agency, and insider network maintains power. Restrict knowledge, control interpretation, punish unauthorized disclosure.

**Dynamics:** Information asymmetry is unstable -- it degrades over time as information leaks. The rate of degradation determines the window of opportunity. In the internet age, degradation is fast. The edge belongs to whoever acts fastest on new information, not whoever holds it longest.

## Force 2: Network Concentration

Connections cluster. Hubs form. The rich get richer in connections (preferential attachment). Power accrues to nodes with more/better connections.

**Questions to ask:**
- What is the network topology? Who are the hubs?
- Where are the structural holes -- gaps between clusters that someone could bridge?
- Who is the broker connecting otherwise disconnected groups?
- Is the network centralizing (hub formation) or fragmenting (hub collapse)?
- What is the cost of connection vs. the value of access?
- Where are weak ties carrying novel information across boundaries?

**Historical pattern:** Hub formation -> monopoly -> fragility -> fragmentation -> redistribution -> new hub formation. This cycle repeats at every scale.

**Dynamics:** Networks concentrate naturally (power law distribution). But concentrated networks are fragile -- remove the hub and the network fragments. This is why Epstein's arrest shattered the entire network. Distributed networks are resilient but slow.

## Force 3: Mimetic Desire

People want what others want. Desire is not internal -- it is borrowed, triangular, contagious. Girard's fundamental insight.

**Questions to ask:**
- Who is imitating whom? What is the model of desire?
- Is the desire genuine or mimetically acquired?
- Where is mimetic rivalry escalating? (two parties wanting the same thing)
- What would the person want if they had never seen anyone else want it?
- Where is the scapegoat mechanism operating? (group projecting internal tension onto a single target)
- What status game is being played? Who defined the metric?

**Historical pattern:** Mimetic desire creates bubbles (everyone wants what everyone wants), status hierarchies (positional competition), and violence (escalating rivalry). The scapegoat mechanism temporarily resolves mimetic crisis by unifying the group against a victim.

**Dynamics:** Mimetic desire is a positive feedback loop -- it escalates until something breaks. The person who can resist mimetic desire while triggering it in others has structural advantage. This is the core asymmetry in marketing, politics, and social manipulation.

## Force 4: Entropy and Disequilibrium

All profit, all opportunity, all advantage exists in disequilibrium -- where things are NOT in balance. Gradients drive flow. Energy moves from high to low concentration.

**Questions to ask:**
- Where is the gradient? What is out of equilibrium?
- Where is pressure building with no outlet?
- What would equilibrium look like? How far are we from it?
- What just created new disequilibrium? (regulation, technology shift, crisis, discovery)
- How fast is this disequilibrium correcting? What is the window?
- Who is positioned at the gradient and who is fighting against it?

**Historical pattern:** Innovation creates disequilibrium. Regulation creates disequilibrium. Crisis creates disequilibrium. Arbitrageurs exploit disequilibrium until equilibrium returns. Then stasis until the next shock.

**Dynamics:** Equilibrium = no opportunity. The thermodynamic view: position where energy naturally flows, don't fight the current. The most common mistake is trying to create gradients rather than finding and exploiting existing ones.

## Force Interactions

The interesting patterns emerge from interactions between forces:

| Interaction | Effect | Example |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Info Asymmetry + Network Concentration | Insider networks; exclusive knowledge clubs | Epstein's network, Skull and Bones |
| Info Asymmetry + Mimetic Desire | Manufactured consensus; propaganda | Marketing, political campaigns |
| Info Asymmetry + Disequilibrium | Insider trading; first-mover advantage | Early AI adopters, regulatory arbitrage |
| Network Concentration + Mimetic Desire | Platform monopolies; social proof cascades | Social media, fashion, tech adoption |
| Network Concentration + Disequilibrium | Hub collapse creates power vacuums | SaaSpocalypse, Epstein fallout |
| Mimetic Desire + Disequilibrium | Bubbles and crashes | Tulips, .com, crypto, AI hype cycles |

When 3-4 forces converge on the same point, that is where maximum opportunity (and maximum risk) lives.
